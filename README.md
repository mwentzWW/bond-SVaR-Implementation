# Project Scope

My goal for this project is to learn the basics of streamlit apps and deployment. I'll create a simple historical value at risk (VaR) tool for treasury product analysis based on public data.

## How to run it on your own machine

1. Install the requirements

   ```
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the app

   ```
   $ streamlit run streamlit_app.py
   ```
